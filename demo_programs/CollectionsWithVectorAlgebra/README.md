Here are the five questions in markdown format:

### 1. Vector Addition

Write a Python program that performs vector addition. Your program should define a function `add_vectors(vector1, vector2)` that takes two vectors as lists and returns their sum as a list. Ensure that both vectors have the same dimension.

**Example Input:**
```python
vector1 = [2, 4, 6]
vector2 = [1, 3, 5]
```

**Example Output:**
```python
[3, 7, 11]
```

### 2. Dot Product of Two Vectors

Write a Python program to compute the dot product of two vectors. Define a function `dot_product(vector1, vector2)` that takes two vectors as lists and returns the dot product.

**Example Input:**
```python
vector1 = [2, 3, 5]
vector2 = [4, -1, 2]
```

**Example Output:**
```python
9
```

### 3. Scalar Multiplication

Write a Python program that performs scalar multiplication on a vector. Define a function `scalar_multiply(scalar, vector)` that multiplies each element of the vector by the scalar and returns the result as a list.

**Example Input:**
```python
scalar = 3
vector = [1, -2, 4]
```

**Example Output:**
```python
[3, -6, 12]
```

### 4. Vector Magnitude (Norm)

Write a Python program to compute the magnitude (or norm) of a vector. Define a function `vector_magnitude(vector)` that calculates the Euclidean norm of a vector.

**Example Input:**
```python
vector = [3, 4]
```

**Example Output:**
```python
5.0
```

---

### 5. Angle Between Two Vectors

Write a Python program to calculate the angle between two vectors in radians. Define a function `angle_between_vectors(vector1, vector2)` that uses the dot product and vector magnitudes to compute the angle.

**Example Input:**
```python
vector1 = [1, 0]
vector2 = [0, 1]
```

**Example Output:**
```python
1.5707963267948966  # Ï€/2 radians (90 degrees)
```

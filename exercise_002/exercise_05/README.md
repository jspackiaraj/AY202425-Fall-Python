# Understanding the Statement: `a, b = b, a + b`

## The Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. In mathematical terms, the sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

```python
    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```

with seed values:

```python
    F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
```

## The Python Implementation
In Python, the Fibonacci sequence can be generated using a loop. A common line of code used in this implementation is:

```python
a, b = b, a + b
```

This line might look confusing at first, so let's break it down.

## Breaking Down the Statement

### Tuple Assignment in Python
The statement `a, b = b, a + b` utilises Python's ability to perform tuple unpacking or multiple assignments in one line. In essence, it swaps and updates the values of `a` and `b`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Right-Hand Side Evaluation:** 
   - First, the right-hand side of the assignment is evaluated. 
   - This means Python calculates the current values of `b` and `a + b` before doing any assignment.

2. **Tuple Packing:** 
   - These two values (`b` and `a + b`) are packed into a tuple. 
   - For example, if `a = 1` and `b = 2`, the tuple becomes `(2, 3)`.

3. **Assignment:** 
   - Finally, the tuple is unpacked, and the first value (`b`) is assigned to `a`, and the second value (`a + b`) is assigned to `b`.
   - Continuing with the previous example, after execution, `a` would become `2`, and `b` would become `3`.

### Why This Works for Fibonacci
This approach efficiently updates the values of `a` and `b` without needing a temporary variable. The `a` and `b` variables in the Fibonacci sequence represent the two most recent values in the sequence, and the statement:

```python
a, b = b, a + b
```

ensures that `a` is always the previous Fibonacci number, and `b` is the current Fibonacci number.

### Additional Information

#### Tuple Unpacking
Tuple unpacking is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to assign multiple variables at once. For example:

```python
x, y = 1, 2
```

Here, `x` will be `1` and `y` will be `2`. The same concept is used in the Fibonacci sequence update.

#### Efficiency
This method is efficient because it reduces the need for an intermediate or temporary variable to hold values during swapping. It also makes the code more concise and readable.

## Conclusion
The statement `a, b = b, a + b` is a compact and efficient way to generate the next numbers in the Fibonacci sequence by simultaneously updating two variables. Understanding this concept is crucial for writing and optimizing Python code, especially in algorithms involving sequences or iterative calculations.

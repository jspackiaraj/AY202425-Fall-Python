=================================================================

Below are 20 exercise programs designed to help you practice basic Python concepts, such as variables, data types, operators, expressions, and basic input/output. Each exercise includes a question, hints, and the name of the file you should use to complete the task. These exercises do not use loops or functions, making them perfect for beginners.

1\. Simple Greeting
-------------------

**Question:** Write a Python script named `simple_greeting.py` that asks the user for their name and then prints a greeting message.

**Hint:** Use the `input()` function to get the user's name and the `print()` function to display the message.

2\. Addition of Two Numbers
---------------------------

**Question:** Create a Python script named `add_two_numbers.py` that asks the user to enter two numbers and then prints their sum.

**Hint:** Use the `input()` function to read the numbers as strings and `int()` to convert them to integers before adding.

3\. Calculate the Square of a Number
------------------------------------

**Question:** Write a Python script named `calculate_square.py` that reads a number from the user and prints its square.

**Hint:** To find the square, multiply the number by itself.

4\. Check for Even or Odd Number
--------------------------------

**Question:** Create a Python script named `even_or_odd.py` that checks whether a given number is even or odd.

**Hint:** Use the modulus operator `%` to determine if the number is divisible by 2.

5\. Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
---------------------------------

**Question:** Write a Python script named `celsius_to_fahrenheit.py` that converts a temperature given in Celsius to Fahrenheit.

**Hint:** Use the formula `F = (C * 9/5) + 32` to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.

6\. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
-------------------------------------

**Question:** Create a Python script named `area_rectangle.py` that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.

**Hint:** The area of a rectangle is calculated using the formula `Area = length * width`.

7\. Calculate Simple Interest
-----------------------------

**Question:** Write a Python script named `simple_interest.py` that calculates simple interest using the formula `SI = (P * R * T) / 100`, where `P` is the principal amount, `R` is the rate of interest, and `T` is the time period.

**Hint:** Read the values of `P`, `R`, and `T` from the user.

8\. Find the Largest of Three Numbers
-------------------------------------

**Question:** Create a Python script named `largest_of_three.py` that reads three numbers from the user and prints the largest one.

**Hint:** Use the `if-elif-else` statements to compare the three numbers.

9\. Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero
----------------------------------------------------

**Question:** Write a Python script named `check_number.py` that reads a number from the user and checks whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

**Hint:** Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to handle the different cases.

10\. Calculate the Perimeter of a Rectangle
-------------------------------------------

**Question:** Create a Python script named `perimeter_rectangle.py` that calculates the perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width.

**Hint:** The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula `Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)`.

11\. Convert Kilometers to Miles
--------------------------------

**Question:** Write a Python script named `km_to_miles.py` that converts a distance given in kilometers to miles.

**Hint:** Use the conversion factor `1 kilometer = 0.621371 miles`.

12\. Swap Two Variables
-----------------------

**Question:** Create a Python script named `swap_variables.py` that swaps the values of two variables.

**Hint:** Use a temporary variable to hold one of the values during the swap.

13\. Calculate the Area of a Circle
-----------------------------------

**Question:** Write a Python script named `area_circle.py` that calculates the area of a circle given its radius.

**Hint:** Use the formula `Area = 3.14159 * radius * radius` for the calculation.

14\. Calculate the Average of Three Numbers
-------------------------------------------

**Question:** Create a Python script named `average_three_numbers.py` that reads three numbers from the user and prints their average.

**Hint:** Calculate the average using the formula `Average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3`.

15\. Check if a Year is a Leap Year
-----------------------------------

**Question:** Write a Python script named `leap_year.py` that checks if a given year is a leap year.

**Hint:** A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

16\. Convert Hours and Minutes to Minutes
-----------------------------------------

**Question:** Create a Python script named `time_to_minutes.py` that converts a given time in hours and minutes to total minutes.

**Hint:** Multiply the hours by 60 and add the minutes to get the total minutes.

17\. Reverse a String
---------------------

**Question:** Write a Python script named `reverse_string.py` that reads a string from the user and prints it in reverse.

**Hint:** You can reverse a string using slicing like this: `reversed_string = string[::-1]`.

18\. Calculate the Volume of a Cube
-----------------------------------

**Question:** Create a Python script named `volume_cube.py` that calculates the volume of a cube given its side length.

**Hint:** Use the formula `Volume = side ** 3` for the calculation.

19\. Check if a Number is Divisible by Another
----------------------------------------------

**Question:** Write a Python script named `divisibility_check.py` that checks if one number is divisible by another.

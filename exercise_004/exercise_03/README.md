# Electromagnetic Spectrum Classifier

## Question
Develop a program that classifies a given wavelength (in nanometers) into its corresponding category in the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., Radio waves, Microwaves, Infrared, Visible light, Ultraviolet, X-rays, Gamma rays). Use a dictionary to map wavelength ranges to their respective categories. Test your program with several wavelengths.

## Concept
The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses a range of wavelengths, each corresponding to a different type of electromagnetic radiation. Classifying wavelengths is essential in fields like astronomy, communications, and medical imaging.

## Methods Used
- **Dictionary**: To map wavelength ranges to their corresponding categories.
- **Conditionals**: To determine the category based on the input wavelength.

## Description
The program classifies a given wavelength by checking it against predefined ranges in a dictionary. It outputs the type of electromagnetic radiation the wavelength corresponds to, such as visible light, X-rays, or radio waves.

## Other Applications
This method can be used in designing communication systems, analyzing astronomical data, or developing imaging technologies in medicine.

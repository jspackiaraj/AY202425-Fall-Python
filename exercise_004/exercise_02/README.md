# Quadratic Equation Solver

## Question
Create a program that solves quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. The program should use a tuple to store the coefficients (a, b, c) and return the roots using the quadratic formula. Ensure that your program handles cases where the roots are real, complex, or when there is only one root (i.e., when the discriminant is zero).

## Concept
Quadratic equations are fundamental in algebra and are solved using the quadratic formula. The discriminant determines the nature of the roots (real, complex, or repeated).

## Methods Used
- **Tuple**: To store the coefficients of the quadratic equation.
- **Conditionals**: To determine the nature of the roots based on the discriminant.

## Description
The program solves quadratic equations by first calculating the discriminant. Depending on its value, the program then determines and returns the roots, handling real, complex, or repeated roots appropriately.

## Other Applications
This method can be used in physics for solving kinematic equations, in economics for cost-profit analysis, and in engineering for determining the stability of structures.

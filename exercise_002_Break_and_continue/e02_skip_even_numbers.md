## Exercise 2: Skip Even Numbers

### Problem Statement
Write a program to print all odd numbers between 1 and 20.

### Solution Approach
1. Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 20.
2. Use an `if` condition to check if the current number is even.
3. If the number is even, use the `continue` statement to skip it.
4. Otherwise, print the current number.

### Code
Please refer to the [Python file](e02_skip_even_numbers.py) for the complete solution.

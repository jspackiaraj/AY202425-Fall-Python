## Exercise 5: Find Prime Numbers with Early Exit

### Problem Statement
Write a program to print prime numbers from 2 to 50. Stop the loop if a non-prime number greater than 30 is found.

### Solution Approach
1. Use a `for` loop to iterate from 2 to 50.
2. Use a nested loop to check if a number is prime.
3. If a non-prime number greater than 30 is found, use the `break` statement to exit the loop.
4. Otherwise, print the prime number.

### Code
Please refer to the [Python file](e05_prime_numbers_break.py) for the complete solution.

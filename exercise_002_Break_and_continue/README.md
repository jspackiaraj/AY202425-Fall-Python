# Python Programming Exercises on `break` and `continue`

This repository contains solutions to Python programming exercises designed to help you understand the use of `break` and `continue` statements effectively. These exercises are based on the webpage: [Programming Exercises on break and continue](https://jsp.shiksha/index.php/portfolio/bcse101e-computer-programming-python/introduction-python/programming-exercises-002/programming-exercises-002-break-and-continue).

Each exercise has an `.md` file that explains the question and the solution step by step, enhancing understanding of the concepts. Additionally, `.py` files are provided for each solution.

## Exercise 13: End Loop on User Condition

### Problem Statement
Write a program that keeps asking the user for numbers and prints them until the user enters a negative number.

### Solution Approach
1. Use an appropriate loop (`for` or `while`) based on the problem.
2. Use `if` conditions and either `break` or `continue` statements as needed to control the flow.

### Code
Please refer to the [Python file](e13_end_loop_on_user_condition.py) for the complete solution.

## Exercise 17: Break on Special Character

### Problem Statement
Write a program that iterates over a string and stops when a special character (like '@', '!', etc.) is found.

### Solution Approach
1. Use an appropriate loop (`for` or `while`) based on the problem.
2. Use `if` conditions and either `break` or `continue` statements as needed to control the flow.

### Code
Please refer to the [Python file](e17_break_on_special_character.py) for the complete solution.

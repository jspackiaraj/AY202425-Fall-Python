## Exercise 4: Skip Negative Numbers

### Problem Statement
Write a program to iterate over a list of integers and print only the positive values.

### Solution Approach
1. Use a `for` loop to iterate through the list of integers.
2. Use an `if` condition to check if the current number is negative.
3. If the number is negative, use the `continue` statement to skip it.
4. Otherwise, print the current number.

### Code
Please refer to the [Python file](e04_skip_negative_numbers.py) for the complete solution.

## Exercise 3: Find a Character in a String

### Problem Statement
Write a program to search for the character 'e' in the string "Hello, Python!" and stop the loop when it is found.

### Solution Approach
1. Use a `for` loop to iterate through each character in the string.
2. Use an `if` condition to check if the current character is 'e'.
3. If the character is 'e', use the `break` statement to exit the loop.
4. Otherwise, print the current character.

### Code
Please refer to the [Python file](e03_find_character.py) for the complete solution.

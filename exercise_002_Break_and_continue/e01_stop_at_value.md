## Exercise 1: Stop Printing at a Specific Value

### Problem Statement
Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10, but stop the loop if the number 7 is reached.

### Solution Approach
1. Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10.
2. Use an `if` condition to check if the current number is 7.
3. If the number is 7, use the `break` statement to exit the loop.
4. Otherwise, print the current number.

### Code
Please refer to the [Python file](e01_stop_at_value.py) for the complete solution.

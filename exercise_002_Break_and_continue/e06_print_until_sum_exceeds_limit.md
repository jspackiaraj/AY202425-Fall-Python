## Exercise 6: Print Until Sum Exceeds Limit

### Problem Statement
Write a program to add numbers from 1 upwards until the sum exceeds 100, then stop the loop.

### Solution Approach
1. Use an appropriate loop (`for` or `while`) based on the problem.
2. Use `if` conditions and either `break` or `continue` statements as needed to control the flow.

### Code
Please refer to the [Python file](e06_print_until_sum_exceeds_limit.py) for the complete solution.

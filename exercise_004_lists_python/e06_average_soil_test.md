### **Exercise 6: Average Soil Test Results**

## Problem Overview
This exercise asks you to write a Python function that calculates the average of soil test results. You are given a list of test values, and your task is to compute the average value of these tests.

## Code Explanation
To solve this, we use the `sum()` function to get the total of the list, and then divide it by the number of elements in the list (using the `len()` function) to get the average. We also handle the case where the list might be empty to avoid division by zero.

- **Function signature**: `def calculate_average_soil_test(results: list) -> float:`
- **Input**: A list of soil test values.
- **Output**: The average of the soil test values as a float.

## Python Code
[View Python Code](./e06_average_soil_test.py)

## Usage Instructions
To execute this code, save it as `e06_average_soil_test.py` and run it in a Python environment or terminal:

```bash
python e06_average_soil_test.py
```

The program will output the average soil test result.

## Sample Input/Output
- **Input**: `[80, 95, 88, 92, 85]`
- **Output**: `The average soil test result is: 88.0`

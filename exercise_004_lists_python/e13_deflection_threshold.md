### **Exercise 13: Find Deflection Beyond a Threshold**

## Problem Overview
This exercise requires you to write a Python function that finds all deflection values greater than a specified threshold (e.g., 10 mm). The function should return the indices of the deflection values that exceed the threshold.

## Code Explanation
To solve this, we use Pythonâ€™s `enumerate()` function to get both the index and value of each element as we iterate through the list. For each deflection value greater than the threshold, we store its index.

- **Function signature**: `def find_deflection_above_threshold(deflections: list, threshold: float) -> list:`
- **Input**: A list of deflection values and a threshold value.
- **Output**: A list of indices where the deflection values exceed the threshold.

## Python Code
[View Python Code](./e13_deflection_threshold.py)

## Usage Instructions
To execute this code, save it as `e13_deflection_threshold.py` and run it in a Python environment or terminal:

```bash
python e13_deflection_threshold.py
```

The program will output the indices of deflection values that exceed the threshold.

## Sample Input/Output
- **Input**:
  - `deflections = [0, -5, -15, -20, -8, 0]`
  - `threshold = -10`
- **Output**: `Indices of deflections above threshold: [2, 3]`

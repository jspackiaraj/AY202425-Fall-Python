### **Exercise 17: Find Common Load Cases**

## Problem Overview
This exercise requires you to write a Python function that finds the common load cases between two different lists of load values. The function should return a new list containing the load values that appear in both input lists.

## Code Explanation
To solve this, we can use Pythonâ€™s set intersection operation. By converting both lists into sets, we can quickly find the common elements that exist in both lists.

- **Function signature**: `def find_common_loads(loads1: list, loads2: list) -> list:`
- **Input**: Two lists of load values.
- **Output**: A new list of load values that are common between the two input lists.

## Python Code
[View Python Code](./e17_common_load_cases.py)

## Usage Instructions
To execute this code, save it as `e17_common_load_cases.py` and run it in a Python environment or terminal:

```bash
python e17_common_load_cases.py
```

The program will output the common load values from both lists.

## Sample Input/Output
- **Input**: `loads1 = [10, 20, 30, 40]`, `loads2 = [30, 40, 50, 60]`
- **Output**: `Common loads: [30, 40]`

## How to Use

Each exercise has its own markdown file with a problem overview, code explanation, usage instructions, and sample input/output. You can follow the links above to view detailed explanations of each problem.

For each exercise, you can also view the corresponding Python code by clicking the "View Python Code" link within the markdown file.

## Running the Programs

To run the programs locally:

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the desired exercise.
4. Run the Python script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python <filename>.py
   ```

For example, to run Exercise 1, you would run:

```bash
python e01_total_load.py
```

_Ensure that you are in directory where the script is stored._

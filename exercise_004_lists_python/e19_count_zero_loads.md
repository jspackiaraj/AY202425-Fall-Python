### **Exercise 19: Count the Number of Zero Loads**

## Problem Overview
This exercise requires you to write a Python function that counts the number of zero loads in a list of load values. The function should take a list of load values as input and return the count of zero values in that list.

## Code Explanation
To solve this, we use Pythonâ€™s `count()` method, which counts the occurrences of a specific value in a list.

- **Function signature**: `def count_zero_loads(loads: list) -> int:`
- **Input**: A list of load values.
- **Output**: The number of zero loads in the list.

## Python Code
[View Python Code](./e19_count_zero_loads.py)

## Usage Instructions
To execute this code, save it as `e19_count_zero_loads.py` and run it in a Python environment or terminal:

```bash
python e19_count_zero_loads.py
```

The program will output the number of zero load values in the list.

## Sample Input/Output
- **Input**: `[10, 0, 20, 0, 30]`
- **Output**: `Number of zero loads: 2`

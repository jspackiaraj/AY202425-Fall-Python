### **Exercise 5: Find All Points Within a Given Range**

## Problem Overview
This exercise asks you to write a Python function that identifies all the survey points that fall within a specified range. The function should take a list of points and two values defining the start and end of the range, and it should return the points that lie within this range.

## Code Explanation
To solve this, we use a list comprehension to iterate through the given list of points and check if the pointâ€™s distance falls within the provided range.

- **Function signature**: `def find_points_in_range(points: list, start: float, end: float) -> list:`
- **Input**: A list of survey points (represented as a list of coordinates), and two floating-point numbers representing the range (start and end).
- **Output**: A list of points that lie within the given range.

## Python Code
[View Python Code](./e05_points_in_range.py)

## Usage Instructions
To execute this code, save it as `e05_points_in_range.py` and run it in a Python environment or terminal:

```bash
python e05_points_in_range.py
```

The program will output the list of points that fall within the specified range.

## Sample Input/Output
- **Input**: `points = [[0, 0], [50, 5], [100, 10], [150, 8], [200, 3], [250, 5], [300, 0]]`, range = 100 to 200
- **Output**: `[[100, 10], [150, 8], [200, 3]]`

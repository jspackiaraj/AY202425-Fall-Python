### **Exercise 8: Insert Missing Data at Specific Positions**

## Problem Overview
This exercise requires you to write a Python function that inserts missing data points (represented by `None`) at specific positions in a list. You are provided with a list of data and a list of positions where the missing data should be inserted.

## Code Explanation
To solve this, we use Python's `insert()` method, which allows us to insert an element at a specific position in a list. We iterate over the list of positions and insert `None` at each specified index.

- **Function signature**: `def insert_missing_data(data: list, positions: list) -> list:`
- **Input**: A list of data points and a list of positions where `None` should be inserted.
- **Output**: The list of data points with `None` inserted at the specified positions.

## Python Code
[View Python Code](./e08_insert_missing_data.py)

## Usage Instructions
To execute this code, save it as `e08_insert_missing_data.py` and run it in a Python environment or terminal:

```bash
python e08_insert_missing_data.py
```

The program will output the list of data with `None` inserted at the specified positions.

## Sample Input/Output
- **Input**:
  - `data = [0, 5, 10, 15, 20]`
  - `positions = [1, 3]`
- **Output**: `Data after inserting missing values: [0, None, 5, 10, None, 15, 20]`

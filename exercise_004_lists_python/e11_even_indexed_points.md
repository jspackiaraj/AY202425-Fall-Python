### **Exercise 11: Extract Even-Indexed Survey Points**

## Problem Overview
This exercise requires you to write a Python function that extracts the survey points located at even-indexed positions in a list. The function should take a list of survey points as input and return a new list containing only the points from even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.).

## Code Explanation
To solve this, we use Pythonâ€™s list slicing technique with a step value of 2, which allows us to extract every second element from the list, starting from index 0.

- **Function signature**: `def extract_even_indexed_points(points: list) -> list:`
- **Input**: A list of survey points.
- **Output**: A new list containing the survey points at even indices.

## Python Code
[View Python Code](./e11_even_indexed_points.py)

## Usage Instructions
To execute this code, save it as `e11_even_indexed_points.py` and run it in a Python environment or terminal:

```bash
python e11_even_indexed_points.py
```

The program will output the list of survey points at even indices.

## Sample Input/Output
- **Input**: `[[0, 0], [50, 5], [100, 10], [150, 8], [200, 3]]`
- **Output**: `Even-indexed points: [[0, 0], [100, 10], [200, 3]]`
